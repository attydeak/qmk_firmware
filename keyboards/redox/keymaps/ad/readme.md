----
![ad-redox-layout-5](https://github.com/attydeak/keyboard/blob/main/redox.png?raw=true)

----

This keymap is **a work in progress**, and is meant to be used on LINUX, Windows, MAC, with the "Unicode Hex Input"
keyboard input.

I may change a lot of the keys over the next few months, and will update this repo when I do so.

## Layers

My keymap uses 5 layers:

1. The default base layer, using QWERTY.
2. A Navigation / Media layer, with both sound control and arrows on the home row. (bottom right legends)
3. A Symbol layer, so all symbols can be accessed from the home row. (top right legends)
4. An international / Emoji layer so I can type a few Emoji I often use. (top center legends)
5. A keyboard control layer, not pictured above, allowing me to control the Boot and the keyboard debug functions.

## Changelog

- 2023-01-24
